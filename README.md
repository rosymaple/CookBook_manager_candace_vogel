# CookBook_manager_candace_vogel

In my cookbook_manager code, I implemented a recipe tagging system and a bookbook borrowing tracker. I implemented both one-to-many tables and a many-to-many table.

In order to run this database successfully you can only run the code once, then you have to delete the hipster_cookbook.db file and run it again. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS would alleviate this problem.
